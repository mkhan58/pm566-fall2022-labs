## Step 1. Read in the data
First download and then read in with data.table:fread()

```{r}
#if file does not exist in my dir, then download it (avoid downloading mult times)
if (!file.exists("met_all.gz")){
 download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/master/02_met/met_all.gz", url = "met_all.gz",method="libcurl", timeout = 60) 
}

met <- data.table::fread("met_all.gz") 
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
